Using Lists to Manage Sharing

You can easily control who you share with by separating your friends into lists. Once you've created a list, you can choose to share certain things with only the people on that list. You can also share something with everyone except for a certain list of friends.

 

(40) Communities

Let's say you're looking for an easy way to keep in touch with a small group of friends, like a book club or softball team. Rather than sharing with each friend separately, you could use a Micple group. It's easy to join an existing group or create your own. Communities make it easy for everyone to share with one another. For example, members of a group can:

Notify other members about upcoming events

Plan future events and meetings

Share posts and photos with other members

 

There are three types of Communities on Micple , depending on the group's privacy settings:

Open: Anyone can view the group, its members, and their posts

Closed: Anyone can view the group and its members, but only members can see group posts.
