  static const String privacyPolicyText = '''Data Policy

This policy describes the information that we process to support Micple Social media or search engine or the other products and services and features offered by Micple Platforms, Inc. (Micple Products or services). You can find additional tools and information in the Micple settings and Micple search engine settings.

How do we use this information?

We use the information that we have (subject to choices that you make) as described below and to provide and support the Micple Products and related services described in the Micple Terms and Micple Terms. Here's how:

 

Provide, personalise and improve our Products

We use the information that we have to deliver our Products, including to personalise features and content (including your ads, Micple News Feed, Micple feed and Micple Stories) and make suggestions for you (such as groups or events that you may be interested in or topics that you may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalised Products that are unique and relevant to you, we use your connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data that we collect and learn from you and others (including any data with special protections you choose to provide); how you use and interact with our Products; and the people, places or things that you're connected to and interested in on and off our Products. Learn more about how we use information about you to personalise your Micple and Micple experience, including features, content and recommendations in Micple Products; you can also learn more about how we choose the ads that you see.

 

Product research and development

 We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Products, including by conducting surveys and research, and testing and troubleshooting new products and features.

 

Ads and other sponsored content

We use the information we have about you – including information about your interests, actions and connections – to select and personalise ads, offers and other sponsored content that we show you. Learn more about how we select and personalise ads, and your choices over the data we use to select ads and other sponsored content for you in the Micple Settings and Micple platforms Settings.

 

Information across Micple Products and devices

We connect information about your activities on different Micple Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Micple Products that you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Micple that includes people you follow on Micple or communicate with using Messenger. We can also make your experience more seamless, for example, by automatically filling in your registration information (such as your phone number) from one Micple Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product.

Location-related information

We use location-related information – such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go, and the businesses and people you're near – to provide, personalise and improve our Products, including ads, for you and others. Location-related information can be based on things such as precise device location (if you've allowed us to collect it), IP addresses and information from your and others' use of Micple Products (such as check-ins or events that you attend).

Providing measurement, analytics and other business services

We use the information that we have (including your activity off our Products, such as the websites you visit and ads you see) to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their websites, apps and services. Learn how we share information with these partners.

Promoting safety, integrity and security

We use the information that we have to verify accounts and activity, combat harmful conduct, detect and prevent spam and other bad experiences, maintain the integrity of our Products, and promote safety and security on and off of Micple Products. For example, we use data that we have to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our Terms or Policies, or to detect when someone needs help. To learn more, visit the Micple Security Help Centre and Micple Security Tips.

Researching and innovating for social good

We use the information that we have (including from research partners we collaborate with) to conduct and support research and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being. For example, we analyze information we have about migration patterns during crises to aid relief efforts. Learn more about our research programmes.

Communicate with you

We use the information that we have to send you marketing communications, communicate with you about our Products and let you know about our Policies and Terms. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.

How is this information shared?

Your information is shared with others in the following ways

 

Content that others share or reshare about you

You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience that you shared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.


People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.

Sharing on Micple Products

People and accounts that you share and communicate with

When you share and communicate using our Products, you choose the audience for what you share. For example, when you post on Micple, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public or a customized list of people.

Similarly, when you use Messenger or Micple to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. Your network can also see actions that you have taken on our Products, including engagement with ads and sponsored content. We also let other accounts see who has viewed their Micple or Micple Stories. Public information can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don't have an account. This includes your Micple username, any information you share with a public audience, information in your public profile on Micple, and content you share on a Micple Page, public Micple account or any other public forum, such as Micple Marketplace. You, other people using Micple and Micple and we can provide access to or send public information to anyone on or off our Products, including in other Micple Company Products, in search results or through tools and APIs. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs and offline media such as TV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products. Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Social media or search engine or the other products and services.

 

Information about your active status or presence on our Products

People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Micple, Messenger or Micple social media, or when you last used our Products.

Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Products

When you choose to use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Micple friends or use a Micple Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Micple. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Micple, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites that you use may receive your list of Micple friends if you choose to share it with them.

 

But apps and websites that you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Micple friends from you, or information about any of your Micple followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one. Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Micple social media and Micple search engine service (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information that you choose to share with them, including information that your friends share with you, so that they can provide our core functionality to you.


Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Micple and Micple data if you haven't used their app in three months, and we are changing login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Micple username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.

New owner

If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.

Partners who use our analytics services

We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Micple Pages, videos and other content on and off the Micple Products. For example, Micple Page admins and Micple business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their account or Micple Page.

 

 

Sharing with third-party partners

We work with third-party partners who help us and improve our Products or who use Micple Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world. We don't sell any of your information to anyone and we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. Here are the types of third parties that we share information with-

Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information for advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in India and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

Measurement partners

We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.

Vendors and service providers

We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.

 

Partners offering goods and services in our Products

When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information that you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.

Researchers and academics

We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that supports our business or mission and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.

Law enforcement or legal requests

We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below. Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Micple settings and Micple search engine service settings.

What kinds of information do we collect?

To provide the Micple Products, we must process information about you. The type of information that we collect depends on how you use our Products. You can learn how to access and delete information that we collect by visiting the Micple settings and Micple Social media settings.

 

 

Things that you and others do and provide

 

Information and content you provide

 We collect the content, communications and other information you provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content and message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content that you provide (e.g. Micple data), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what you see through features that we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things such as suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process content and communications that you and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for the purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.

Your usage

We collect information about how you use our Products, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the features you use, the actions you take, the people or accounts you interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos and other content you view on our Products. We also collect information about how you use features such as our camera.

 

Data with special protections

You can choose to provide information in your Micple profile fields or life events about your religious views, political views, who you are "interested in" or your health. This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to special protections under the laws of your country.

Information about transactions made on our Products

If you use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information, other account and authentication information, and billing, delivery and contact details.

 

Things others do and information they provide about you

We also receive and analyse content, communications and information that other people provide when they use our Products. This can include information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you or upload, sync or import your contact information.

Networks and connections: We collect information about the people, accounts, hashtags, Micple groups and Pages that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups that you are part of. We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things such as helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.

 

Device information

As described below, we collect information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our Products, and we combine this information across different devices that you use. For example, we use information collected about your use of our Products on your phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features that you see when you use our Products on another device, such as your laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in response to an ad that we showed you on your phone on a different device.



Information that we obtain from these devices includes

Device attributes

Information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins.

 

Network and connections

information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases, information about other devices that are nearby or on your network, so we can do things such as help you stream a video from your phone to your TV.

 

Device operations

Information about operations and behaviours performed on the device, such as whether a window is in the foreground or background, or mouse movements (which can help distinguish humans from bots).

Device signals

Bluetooth signals, information about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons and mobile phone masts.

Data from device settings

Information you allow us to receive through device settings that you turn on, such as access to your GPS location, camera or photos.

Cookie data

Data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we use cookies in the Micple Cookies Policy and Micple Cookies Policy.

Identifiers

Unique identifiers, device IDs and other identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts that you use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Micple Company Products associated with the same device or account).

 

Information from partners

Advertisers, app developers and publishers can send us information through Micple Business Tools that they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Micple Login, our APIs and SDKs or the Micple pixel. These partners provide information about your activities off of our Products – including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see and how you use their services – whether or not you have an account or are logged in to our Products. For example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could tell us about a purchase you made in its shop. We also receive information about your online and offline actions and purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with your information.


Partners receive your data when you visit or use their services, or through third parties that they work with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use and share your data before providing us with any data. Learn more about the types of partners we receive data from.


To learn more about how we use cookies in connection with Micple Business Tools, review the Micple Cookies Policy and Micple Cookies Policy.

How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?

We share information globally, both internally within the Micple Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy. Your information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the Bangladesh or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this Policy. These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Micple Terms and Micple Social media or search engine Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you. We utilise standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the Bangladesh and other countries.

How can I manage or delete information about me?

We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and delete your data. Learn more in your Micple social media settings and Micple search engine settings.

When you delete your account, we delete things that you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the Micple social media settings and Micple search engine settings.

We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Micple Products, or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Micple, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after six months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.

 

How do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?

We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others

In response to a legal request (e.g. a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the Bangladesh when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction and is consistent with internationally recognised standards.

When we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorised use of the Products, breaches of our Terms or Policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory enquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.

Information that we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made on our Products) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for term breaches for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term breaches.

How do the Micple Companies work together?

Micple social media and Micple search engine service share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Micple Companies to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Micple Company Products that you use. We also process information about you across the Micple Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies. For example, we process information from Micple social media about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Micple, Micple search engine or Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Micple Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Micple Company Products.

How will we notify you of changes to this Policy?

We'll notify you before we make changes to this Policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised Policy before you choose to continue using our Products.

Cookies and other storage technologies

Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and other devices. Other technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar purposes.

In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as "cookies".


We use cookies if you have a Micple account, use the Micple Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Micple Products (including the Like button). Cookies enable Micple to offer the Micple Products to you and to understand the information that we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.



This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Data Policy will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies.

 

Where do we use cookies?

We may place cookies on your computer or device and receive information stored in cookies when you use or visit The Micple Products; Products provided by other members of the Micple Companies; and Websites and apps provided by other companies that use the Micple Products, including companies that incorporate Micple technologies into their websites and apps. Micple uses cookies and receives information when you visit those sites and apps, including device information and information about your activity, without any further action from you. This occurs whether or not you have a Micple account or are logged in.

 

 

Do other Companies use cookies in connection with the Micple Products?

Yes, other companies use cookies on the Micple Products to provide advertising, measurement, marketing and analytics services to us, and to provide certain features and improve our services for you.

For example, other companies' cookies help tailor ads off Micple Products, measure their performance and effectiveness and support marketing and analytics. Certain features on the Micple Products use cookies from other companies to function, for example, certain maps, payment and security features. Learn more about the companies that use cookies on the Micple Products.

Third-party companies also use cookies on their own sites and apps in connection with the Micple Products. To understand how other companies use cookies, please review their policies.

Why do we use cookies?

Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Micple Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay in your browser until they expire or you delete them. While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Micple Products, we use them for the following purposes:

 

Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement

We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organizations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.

For example: Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business's website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don't see the same ad over and over again. For example, the "fr" cookie is used to deliver, measure and improve the relevancy of ads, with a lifespan of 90 days.

We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Micple Products.

For example: We use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how often people do things, such as make a purchase following an ad impression.

 

Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.

For example: We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.

Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Micple Products, as well as the people who interact with the ads, websites and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Micple Products.

For example: We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Micple social media or use their apps so that they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.

We also use cookies to help you opt out of seeing ads from Micple based on your activity on third-party websites. Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off the Micple Products and the controls that are available to you.

 

Performance

We use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.

For example: Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Micple Products load for different people. Cookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you've enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly.

Analytics and research

We use cookies to better understand how people use the Micple Products so that we can improve them.

For example: Cookies can help us understand how people use the Micple service, analyse which parts of our Products people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.

Authentication

We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you're logged in so that we can make it easier for you to access the Micple Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.

For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Micple Pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you don't have to keep logging in to Micple and so you can more easily log in to Micple via third-party apps and websites. For example, we use the "c_user" and "xs" cookies, including for this purpose, which have a lifespan of 365 days.

Security, site and product integrity

We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Micple Products safe and secure.

For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Micple account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password, or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked. We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Micple Products.

For example: Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Micple accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm.. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Micple accounts.

Site features and services

We use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Micple Products.

For example: Cookies help us store preferences, know when you've seen or interacted with Micple Products' content and provide you with customised content and experiences. For instance, cookies allow us to make suggestions to you and others, and to customise content on third-party sites that integrate our social plugins. If you are a Micple Page administrator, cookies allow you to switch between posting from your personal Micple account and the Micple Page. We use cookies such as the session-based "presence" cookie to support your use of Messenger chat windows.

We also use cookies to help provide you with content relevant to your locale.

For example: We store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so that you will see the site in your preferred language.

Third-party websites and apps

Our business partners may also choose to share information with Micple from cookies set in their own websites' domains, whether or not you have a Micple account or are logged in. Unlike cookies that are set on Micple's own domains, these cookies aren't accessible by Micple when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set, including when you are on one of our domains. They serve the same purposes as cookies set in Micple's own domain, which are to personalise content (including ads), measure ads, produce analytics and provide a safer experience, as set out in this Cookies Policy.

How can you control your information?

We use cookies to help personalise and improve content and services, provide a safer experience and to show you useful and relevant ads on and off Micple Products. You can control how we use data to show you ads and more by using the tools described below.

If you have a Micple account

You can review your off-Micple activity, which is a summary of activity that businesses and organizations share with us about your interactions with them, such as visiting their apps or websites. They use our business tools, such as Micple Pixel, to share this information with us. This helps us do things such as give you a more personalised experience on Micple Products. Learn more about off-Micple activity, how we use it and how you can manage it.

You can use your ad preferences to learn why you're seeing a particular ad and control how we use information that we collect to show you ads.

To show you better ads, we use data that advertisers and other partners provide us about your activity off Micple Company Products, including websites and apps. You can control whether we use this data to show you ads in your ad settings.

The Micple Audience Network is a way for advertisers to show you ads in apps and websites off the Micple Company Products. One of the ways that Audience Network shows relevant ads is by using your ad preferences to determine which ads you may be interested in seeing. You can control this in your ad settings.

 

 

Browser cookie controls

In addition, your browser or device may offer settings that allow you to choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them. These controls vary by browser, and manufacturers may change both the settings that they make available and how they work at any time. Certain parts of the Micple Products may not work properly if you have disabled browser cookie use. Please be aware that these controls are distinct from the controls that we offer you.
