FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. What is CPA Marketing?

CPA stands for Cost Per Action. Unlike other marketing models where an advertiser pays for every user seeing their ad (CPM) or clicking on their ad (CPC), an advertiser under the CPA model pays only when a specific action is taken on their website. The advertiser defines this action in advance and only pays when that action is taken. The advertiser action can be as simple as filling out a form on their website or as complex as a multi-page sign-up ending with a purchase through credit card. Generally speaking, the more involved the action, the higher an affiliate would expect to be paid for generating it.

 

2.What role does Micple.com play in online advertising?

Affiliates seek to generate advertising revenue from their websites and mailings lists but often lack in time or size to deal directly with multiple large sponsors. On the flipside, advertisers want traffic to generate sales and leads for their websites without the commitment of dealing with hundreds of individual affiliates. Micple.com acts as a single point of contact for advertisers and affiliates, acting as a trusted source for both sides. Affiliates benefit from having access to thousands of advertising campaigns and receiving a single aggregated "always on time" commission payment from Micple. Advertisers benefit by having their CPA campaigns made available to thousands of affiliates without having to recruit or maintain a single one.

 

3. Affiliate Payment Schedule

Micple provides two flexible payment options for affiliates working on campaigns, each designed to accommodate different earning levels and preferences.

3.1 Regular Weekly Payment

All affiliates receive their earnings on a weekly basis, with payments scheduled every Sunday. A minimum balance of \$100 is required before any payment is issued; if your balance does not meet this minimum, your earnings will roll over to the next weekly cycle until the \$100 threshold is achieved. Once qualified, your campaign earnings will be processed on Sunday and should appear in your account within 1-3 business days, depending on your payment method.

3.2 Special Instant Daily Payment for High Earners

Micple also offers an expedited, same-day payout option for affiliates whose daily earnings reach or exceed \$1,000.

•Instant Daily Payouts: High-earning affiliates who reach a minimum of \$1,000 in daily earnings are eligible for an automatic, same-day payout processed according to Eastern Standard Time (EST). To qualify, you must reach this target within a 24-hour period from 10:00 am to 10:00 am EST. No prior approval is required; your payout will automatically be processed if you meet the target.

•Eligibility Requirements: To ensure your account is eligible for instant payouts, it must comply with all Micple terms and conditions and be free of any disputes or violations.

 

3.3 Payment Methods

Micple supports a variety of payment methods, including local bank transfers and digital currency transfers, to provide flexibility and convenience. Please verify that your payment details are accurate and up-to-date to avoid any delays in processing.

3.4 Currency and Transaction Fees

All payments are made in USD. Any fees associated with currency conversion or transactions by payment providers will be the responsibility of the recipient.

 

4.How are affiliates paid?

We pay affiliates via Bank Transfer payment platforms. Options available depend on an affiliate's home country. 

 

5.Does Micple accept international affiliates?

We accept affiliates from the majority of countries globally.

 

6.When the campaign section becomes inactive?

If a user does not engage with the campaign section for 07 consecutive days, it will automatically become inactive. During this period, all associated payments will be placed on hold. To resume access and withdraw any held payments, you must continue working in the campaign section and earn a minimum of \$100.

 

7.Are leads/sales tracked in Server to server or manual ?

In most cases, leads and sales are tracked in Manual Tracking, but there can be up to 72 hours delay for Manual Tracking.

"Even with manual tracking, lead mining is not possible. Leads sent from traffic types other than those specifically requested to be sent for that campaign will not be counted.

 

8.Can I have my friends sign up for my Micple account or have them work in the campaign section?

No, this is against Micple's account terms. Affiliates are not permitted to generate their own leads or enlist friends to sign up on their behalf. The primary requirement for participating in campaigns is having an active Micple account. Additionally, team-based work within the campaign section is not allowed.

 

9.Why is it I'm not seeing any leads/sales generated on a campaign when I know leads/sales must have been generated?

There are a number of reasons why this could happen. These include, but are not limited to users visiting a campaign page through another affiliate link, users entering invalid data, users not fully completing the signup, user data not matching campaign demographic requirements, and surfers having cookies disabled on their computer. Generally speaking, most cases of untracked test or friend-generated leads are explained by an affiliate simply unfamiliar with all the details an advertiser requires to validate a lead as real.

 

10.What is incentive traffic and is it allowed?

Incentive traffic is when an affiliate offers a user a reward of some kind (virtual or real) to sign up to an advertiser through their affiliate link. A potential affiliate must understand that while Micple does allow some forms of incentive traffic, affiliates using incentive traffic will be limited to advertising only the few ad campaigns which accept it. Most campaigns do not accept incentive traffic. We're very selective on the kinds of incentive traffic we accept and very strict on incentive affiliate adherence to only advertising the campaigns which allow it.

 

11.Can I use traffic sources like Google Ads, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc?

Affiliates are permitted to purchase approved ad placements from third-party traffic sources. Each campaign on Micple has specific rules regarding which traffic sources are allowed. For example, some advertisers may request that their campaigns do not include social network traffic, and affiliates must adhere to such requests. Affiliates are responsible for ensuring that the nature and quality of their advertising comply with the terms of service and advertising guidelines of the traffic sources they use.

 

12.What if I don't want certain traffic types used to promote my campaign?

Advertisers can however specify in advance whether they want to exclude certain types of traffic for their campaign. For example: 'No paid search engine traffic', or 'No social media traffic'.

 

13.Why do my paid clicks stats from Google Ads/Bing/Facebook/Tiktok etc. not match the number of clicks showing in Micple?

Click tracking between two sources never matches 100%. Some of the clicks an affiliate purchases from a third party might get IP /vpn/proxy/server etc filtered because they are from a country the campaign doesn't accept.  Even if you're buying specific country-targeted traffic to send to a campaign accepting traffic from that same country, rarely does the logic behind two IP filters match 100%. It could also be that the surfer abandons the browser before a click is tracked on both sides. A small discrepancy in click stats is expected and normal.

 

14.Can I do a joint venture (JV) where I allow someone else access to my account for a share of the profits they generate?

No, this is directly against Micple's affiliate terms and conditions. Just like selling your affiliate account, the bulk of those interested in joint ventures do so with intent of defrauding advertisers. An affiliate is solely responsible for the leads generated on a campaign. Should the second party in the joint venture generate fraudulent leads/sales, it's the affiliate who risks account termination and litigation, not the second party.

 

15.My Micple campaign section was terminated but I want to plead my case. What should I do?

In most cases, by the time you've received the termination email, it's too late. Our compliance department monitors traffic/leads constantly and action is swift when a problem is found. Affiliates are generally told when a minor problem is found and given the opportunity to make corrections. Major problems usually result in immediate account termination. If you want to plead your case, send a reply to the compliance email you received. Your best bet is to admit wrongdoing, accept the reversal of your leads/sales and ask permission to try again. In the rare circumstance that an affiliate is wrongly terminated from the network, they should reply to the compliance email and politely describe the problem and why they feel they are innocent. Termination of your campaign feature does not mean termination of your Micple account. All other features of your Micple will be open, only the campaign feature will be closed.

 

16.My campaign section was terminated, but only some of my leads were generated fraudulently. Will I still be paid?

No, partial fraud does not result in partial payment. If any leads are found to be fraudulent, no payment will be issued for that campaign section.

 

17.I'm not using my campaign section. Can I sell or transfer it?

No, you may not. It is grounds for account termination or worse. Only people interested in acquiring dormant affiliate accounts do so with the intent of defrauding advertisers. If an affiliate sells their account, they're likely assisting someone in committing a crime and are subject to potential litigation. Micple fully supports advertisers and law enforcement agencies in their attempts to prosecute fraud. If you don't want your affiliate account anymore, simply tell your affiliate manager and we'll close it for you.

 

18. Can I contact the advertisers directly?

No, direct contact between affiliates and advertisers is not allowed. All communication is handled through the network, where you will have a dedicated Account Manager. Affiliates use Micple to benefit from having a single point of contact for multiple promotional opportunities.

 

19.What can we do to ensure we get quality leads?

Micple puts potential affiliates through an identity screening, and quality assurance and fraud checks before we allow them into the network. The internal Compliance Team also monitors traffic daily for spikes and trends in lead activity. This helps reduce the occurrence of fraud and badleads. However, Advertisers must also work at monitoring data and reporting problems as needed. Micple does not have insight into the lead form data captured by the advertiser, or how conversions are monetizing for the advertiser. Advertisers are passed the IDs of the affiliates generating traffic for their campaign. Advertisers should use this ID with their internal quality checks and reporting to analyze the profitability of the traffic they are receiving on an individual affiliate ID level. Micple can help optimize the campaign with the Advertiser, provided there is the timely and accurate sharing of feedback.

 

20.How does tracking work?

Micple uses postbacks to track actions. We provide the advertiser with a postback URL to place in their tracking platform, or directly to their website's backend. When the user clicks through and completes the action, the postback calls back to our server to declare the action is valid. The server call credits the correct affiliate and correct campaign for the action generated.

 

21.How much volume can you do on my campaign?

Micple can't predict exact traffic volumes on potential campaigns. There are many factors that must be considered - much depends on the conversion of the campaign, the target countries and demographics, the decided upon payout versus competitive campaigns, and the mix of affiliates who are actively promoting the campaign. Some campaigns can see hundreds of thousands of clicks and leads, while others might be promoted on a smaller scale.

 

 

22.How do I find out if Micple will take me on as an advertiser?

Send us some details about the campaign you'd like to bring to Micple through the contact us page. Please include as much information as possible about your campaign including sample landing pages, rates or payouts, target countries and budgetary caps. We receive many requests so please do not omit this information.
